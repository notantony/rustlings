# Async (Asynchronous Programming)

Asynchronous programming allows a program to perform tasks concurrently
without blocking the main execution thread. It is particularly useful
for I/O-bound operations, such as network requests or file reading,
where waiting for a response can be done in the background.
In Rust, asynchronous functions are defined using the async keyword
and are executed with the help of an asynchronous runtime like tokio.
This approach improves the efficiency and responsiveness of applications
by enabling them to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
